#  🌟 Django_Crud_Operation
Django, a Python web framework, facilitates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in web applications. With Django Models, you create and save new records ✨, the ORM helps retrieve data 📚, and updates are accomplished by modifying and saving existing records ✏️🚀.

In this project, I have developed a Django-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using the Python programming language. The project also utilizes Bootstrap for creating user-friendly forms. With the help of this project, users can easily manage data in their database.
